#### 2.Player's instruction

1.First open “startScene.html”. If you want to pass the settings step and go directly to game, open"game.html".

2.To start game, draw a circle with your hand. If the website does not jump to the game scene, then check that if leap motion device is properly connected. If this does not work, open the leap motion visualizer and make sure that your hands are in the visualizer window. 

If you want to set up game volume or game level, make a swipe gesture.

To set game volume, put your hand at left of leap motion’s detection area.When the “volume” turns to green, it means that the volume panel is selected, and you can put your hand higher to increase volume or put your hand lower to decrease volume. The number of blocks which turns to white implies current volume intensity. 

3.When entering game, move your hands over leap motion to control the cube to move left or right. Dodge the trees and collect the coins.When bumping into a tree, the score will decrease, but if you quickly get far away from the tree, your score decreased will be less. When accounting a coin, your score will increase.When the score decreases to 0, you’ll die. You can choose to make a swipe gesture to restart the game.

*ATTENTION:The detection area of leap motion is limited, so you can’t keep your hands too far from the device.If you cannot play the game properly, you could check that if your hands are displayed in the visualizer of  leap motion, or that if the leap motion device is properly connected.
